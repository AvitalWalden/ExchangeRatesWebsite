download the project from the github account,
Open the server in Visual Studio and then run it.
Open the client in Visual Studio Code
in the terminal write: cd client,
and then npm i,
and then npm run dev.

Remarks:
Regarding this point:
â€¢ In the backend, instead of faking the exchange rates, use a free API service that provides real data----
I used a website that allowed me to make a request for USD currency exchange rates only, for more complex requests he asked for payment - therefore in the other currencies the data is random.

In addition, during these days I learned Docker independently, I really liked and enjoyed learning it, it's really smart and economical, I'm in the final stages that it will indeed work.
Since a week has passed and I have to submit the project - I am not completely finished.
